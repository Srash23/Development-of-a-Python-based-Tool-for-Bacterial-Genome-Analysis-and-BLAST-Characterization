The primary goal of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that can efficiently analyze bacterial genomes to identify potential open reading frames (ORFs), translate these ORFs into protein sequences, calculate their molecular mass, and perform BLAST analysis. This tool aims to streamline the process of gene identification and characterization, by contributing to our understanding of bacterial genetics.
The sequence used in this project is the complete synthetic genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0, which is a milestone project by the Craig Venter Institute. This work aimed to construct a minimized version of Mycoplasma mycoides bacteriumâ€™s genome, focussing on essential life-sustaining genes. Studying such genomes is crucial for understanding the minimal genetic requirements of life, paving the way for advancements in biotechnology and medicine. Performing BLAST on such genomes is crucial for understanding the biological functions, evolutionary context, and safety of the synthetic constructs, bridging the gap between theoretical design and practical application, and ensuring that synthetic biology advances in a safe, ethical, and scientifically sound manner.
