# Bacterial Genome ORF Analysis and BLAST Pipeline

## Introduction
This project develops a Python-based bioinformatics tool for the analysis of bacterial genomes, enabling:

1. Identification of Open Reading Frames (ORFs).
2. Translation of ORFs into protein sequences.
3. Molecular mass calculation of proteins.
4. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis to find homologous sequences in public databases.

The sequence analyzed in this project is the complete synthetic genome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0, a milestone project by the Craig Venter Institute. Studying this genome provides insights into the minimal genetic requirements for life, contributing to biotechnology and synthetic biology.
